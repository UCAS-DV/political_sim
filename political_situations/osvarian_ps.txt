After a long and bloody civil war, the Osvarian Empire and its allies finally recognized the independence of the Western Osvarian Republic.
The elves of the WOR rejoiced while the human minority feared what the future may have in store for them. Three years later,
a constitution was written, and after a 3 month campaign, the first elections were held. Although it was obvious that the centre-left 
Osvarian Reform Party was going to win, the right-wing Conservative Party of Osvaria greatly outpreformed the expectations of the public
and the polls. It was assumed that the votes were going to be along racial boundaries, but many elves who were projected to vote Reform
ended up voting for the Conservatives. Nonetheless, the Reform Party still won and the Elven party leader Sylvara Dewlight became the 
first Prime Minister of the Western Osvarian Republic.

Take charge in place of Dewlight as Prime Minister and guide the the nation through its first steps or replace the human leader of the 
Conservatives, Andrew Stevens, to keep the Reformists in check. It's your choice.
